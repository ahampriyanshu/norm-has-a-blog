## Welcome to the Test Article

This article is located in `src/blog/tutorials/test-article.md`.

The URL for this article will be: `/blog/tutorials/test-article`

This demonstrates that the subfolder name is now included in the URL path!

## How It Works

- Articles in `src/blog/article.md` → URL: `/blog/article`
- Articles in `src/blog/tutorials/article.md` → URL: `/blog/tutorials/article`
- Articles in `src/blog/guides/deep/article.md` → URL: `/blog/guides/deep/article`

You can organize your articles in any folder structure you want!
